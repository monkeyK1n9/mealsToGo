This app proposes restaurants and their menu. The user can look for restaurants in 4 cities for now, Chicago, Antwerp, San Francisco and Toronto. An update will be soon available to link the app to Google cloud for a wider search.

## Install
1.  Download the package as zip or clone.
2.  Add an apiKey in the app.json file in the `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey`
3.  Run the command `eas build -p android --profile preview` in the terminal

## Registration
When registring an account, your password must not be less than 7 entries. There will be a UI fix to make this more intuitive.

Ready to go, enjoy !!!
